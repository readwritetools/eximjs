## From ES Modules to CommonJS Modules

<table>
	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td>The <span class=product>eximjs</span> command line utility is used to convert ECMAScript module syntax to CommonJS module syntax.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

In 2015, the ECMASCript TC39 standards committee finalized the syntax for
exporting and importing modules. Implementing the full standard has been
problematic, and there has been considerable delay. In the interim, developers
wishing to write forward-compatible code can use the new ES Module syntax and
transpile it back to the old CommonJS syntax. The <span>eximjs</span> command
line utility can be used to do that.

### Prerequisites and installation

The <span>eximjs</span> utility uses Node.js. Package installation is done via
NPM. These are the only two prerequisites.

To install the utility and make it available to your Bash shell, use this
command.

```bash
[user@host]# npm install -g eximjs
```

### Usage

The software is invoked from the command line with:

```bash
[user@host]# eximjs [source file] [destination file] 
```

The following conversions are performed:


<table>
	<tr><th>ECMAScript Modules</th> <th>CommonJS Modules</th></tr>
	<tr><td>import NAME from './path/to/file'</td> 	<td>var NAME = require('./path/to/file')</td></tr>
	<tr><td>import {NAME} from './path/to/file'</td> 	<td>var NAME = require('./path/to/file').NAME</td></tr>
	<tr><td>import NAME from 'nodemodule'</td> 		<td>var NAME = require('nodemodule')</td></tr>
	<tr><td>import {NAME} from 'nodemodule'</td> 		<td>var NAME = require('nodemodule').NAME</td></tr>
	<tr><td>export default</td>						<td>module.exports =</td></tr>
	<tr><td>export class NAME {</td>					<td>module.exports.NAME = class NAME {</td></tr>
	<tr><td>export function NAME () {</td>			<td>module.exports.NAME = function NAME () {</td></tr>
</table>

Note that absolute paths, those beginning with <kbd>/</kbd>, are not allowed.

Also, as of Dec 2019, the Node.js platform allows the filename extension to be
omitted, but the Chrome browser module system does not.

For the most efficient use of resources, this utility should be invoked by a
build tool that is sensitive to file modification timestamps, so that it is
triggered for each file in a nested hierarchy only when a source file is
changed. (The Read Write Tools `prorenata` builder has this capability.)
